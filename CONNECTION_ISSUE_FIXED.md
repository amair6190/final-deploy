# SolvIT Ticketing System - Connection Issue Fixed

## Problem Identified
The main issue was that Gunicorn was configured to listen only on localhost (127.0.0.1), which meant it wasn't accessible from outside the server.

## Solution Applied
We updated the Gunicorn configuration in the systemd service file:

**Changed from:**
```
ExecStart=/opt/solvit-ticketing/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 127.0.0.1:8001 --timeout 60 --keep-alive 2 --max-requests 1000 it_ticketing_system.wsgi:application
```

**Changed to:**
```
ExecStart=/opt/solvit-ticketing/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8001 --timeout 60 --keep-alive 2 --max-requests 1000 it_ticketing_system.wsgi:application
```

## What This Change Does
- `127.0.0.1` (localhost) - Restricts access to the local machine only
- `0.0.0.0` - Allows access from any network interface

## Verification
We confirmed that the service is now listening on all interfaces:
```
$ sudo lsof -i :8001
COMMAND     PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
gunicorn 130628 solvit    5u  IPv4 693206      0t0  TCP *:8001 (LISTEN)
```

We also tested direct access to the application:
```
$ curl -I http://10.0.0.95:8001
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## Next Steps for Using Nginx Proxy Manager
1. Make sure your domain's DNS points to your Nginx Proxy Manager server
2. Configure a proxy host in NPM with:
   - Forward Hostname/IP: 10.0.0.95
   - Forward Port: 8001
   - Domain: support.solvitservices.com
3. Set up SSL certificate through the NPM interface
4. Add the recommended custom Nginx configuration for proper CSRF handling
5. Test the application through your domain
