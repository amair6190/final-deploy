      "text": "**Developing the Core**\n\nI\u0027m currently focused on deconstructing the initial request. The core goal is clear: to build a ticketing system mirroring the functionality of UV Desk. I\u0027m starting by identifying the essential components and features that define a robust ticketing solution. This involves defining the key user roles, the workflows that need to be supported, and the data structures required.\n\n\n**Outlining the Scope**\n\nI\u0027ve been drilling down into the specifics. My focus is on the essential building blocks: user roles, key workflows, and the required data structures. I\u0027m prioritizing features such as multi-level login and WhatsApp integration. I\u0027m mapping out the architecture. The choice between Django, Flask, and FastAPI will determine the structure. External databases and mobile login capabilities are also under consideration.\n\n\n**Refining the Framework**\n\nI\u0027m now zeroing in on the tech stack. Django is the current frontrunner for the backend due to its comprehensive features. I\u0027ve also noted that FastAPI\u0027s strength in APIs makes it suitable. For the frontend, I\u0027ll start with Django templates for ease of development, considering a JavaScript framework later for added interactivity. PostgreSQL is the preferred database option.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Tech Stack**\n\nI\u0027m now refining the tech stack based on the latest insights. Django remains the core backend choice, primarily due to its robust features and inherent structure suitable for building a comprehensive web application. For the frontend, I\u0027ll start with Django templates for quick development, which can be followed by a JavaScript framework later. PostgreSQL is the preferred database, ensuring strong query capabilities and reliability. I\u0027ve also researched the WhatsApp Business API for the integration, ensuring compliance.\n\n\n**Mapping Out Features**\n\nI\u0027m now zeroing in on the detailed functionalities. The scope is now clear. I\u0027m focusing on user roles and the flow of the ticketing system, and I\u0027m designing the data structures to keep the ticket data organized.  I\u0027m also considering the integration with external databases and mobile login features for field engineers.\n\n\n**Mapping Out the Building Blocks**\n\nI\u0027m now focusing on user roles, workflows, and data structures. Django remains the core, with PostgreSQL as the database and Django templates for the frontend. I\u0027m prioritizing the core ticketing functionalities like ticket creation, assignment, and status updates, while integrating WhatsApp Business API. I\u0027m also planning the necessary structures for the multi-level login and external database interactions.\n\n\n**Refining the Core**\n\nI\u0027m now prioritizing the critical features for the ticketing system. Key requirements such as multi-level login and WhatsApp integration are taking center stage. The integration with external databases and mobile login features is also crucial, and I\u0027m looking into the data structures and user roles. I\u0027m focusing on defining the scope and mapping out the functionality.\n\n\n",

      "text": "Okay, this is an ambitious and exciting project! Building a ticketing system like UV Desk from scratch is a significant undertaking, but very rewarding. Let\u0027s break down the requirements and suggestions.\n\n**Core Technology Stack Suggestion:**\n\n*   **Backend Framework:** **Django** or **FastAPI**.\n    *   **Django:** \"Batteries-included\" framework. Excellent for rapid development, comes with an ORM, admin panel, user authentication, templating, and a strong ecosystem. Good choice if you want a more traditional web application structure.\n    *   **FastAPI:** Modern, high-performance framework based on Starlette and Pydantic. Excellent for building APIs, automatic data validation, and interactive API documentation (Swagger UI/ReDoc). You\u0027d likely pair this with a separate frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular) or use Jinja2 for templating if you prefer server-side rendering.\n    *   *My Leaning:* For a full-fledged system like this with user interfaces for different roles, **Django** is often a more straightforward starting point due to its built-in features. FastAPI is fantastic if you\u0027re API-first and plan a very distinct frontend.\n*   **Database:** **PostgreSQL**.\n    *   It\u0027s robust, open-source, highly scalable, and has excellent support for complex queries, JSONB fields (useful for custom ticket fields or logs), and is well-supported by Django\u0027s ORM.\n*   **Frontend (if separate from Django templates):**\n    *   **React, Vue.js, or Svelte:** For a rich, interactive user interface.\n    *   **HTMX/Alpine.js:** If you want to enhance server-rendered Django templates with more interactivity without a full SPA.\n*   **Background Tasks:** **Celery** with **Redis** or **RabbitMQ** as a message broker. Essential for handling things like sending email notifications, WhatsApp messages, processing SLAs, etc., without blocking web requests.\n*   **Caching:** **Redis** or **Memcached** for caching frequently accessed data.\n*   **Deployment:** Docker, Nginx/Gunicorn (for Django/FastAPI), Supervisor.\n\n---\n\n**Functionality Breakdown \u0026 Implementation Ideas:**\n\n**1. Web App:**\n    *   This will be the core interface.\n    *   **Django:** Use Django\u0027s views, templates (or Django Rest Framework if pairing with a JS frontend).\n    *   **FastAPI:** Define API endpoints and either use Jinja2 templates for server-side rendering or build a separate SPA frontend.\n\n**2. Multi-level Login System:**\n    *   **Roles:**\n        *   **Customer:** Can create tickets, view their tickets, reply, close tickets.\n        *   **Agent/Engineer:** Can view assigned/unassigned tickets, reply, change status/priority, assign tickets, add internal notes.\n        *   **Admin:** Full control – manage users, departments, SLAs, settings, view reports, etc.\n    *   **Implementation (Django):**\n        *   Use Django\u0027s built-in `User` model.\n        *   Use Django\u0027s `Groups` and `Permissions` to define roles.\n        *   Create custom user profiles (e.g., `CustomerProfile`, `AgentProfile`) linked to the `User` model if you need role-specific fields.\n        *   Use decorators like `@login_required` and custom permission checks in views.\n\n**3. WhatsApp Integration:**\n\n    *   **a. WhatsApp Business API:**\n        *   **This is the official, recommended, and reliable way.**\n        *   You\u0027ll need to register as a WhatsApp Business Solution Provider (BSP) or use a third-party BSP (e.g., Twilio, Vonage, 360dialog).\n        *   **How it works:**\n            1.  **Receive Messages:** WhatsApp sends incoming messages to a webhook URL you provide. Your Python app will have an endpoint (e.g., `/whatsapp/webhook/`) to receive these JSON payloads.\n            2.  **Process:** Parse the message, identify the sender (phone number).\n                *   If new sender: Create a new user/contact and a new ticket.\n                *   If existing sender: Find their open tickets or create a new one, and append the message.\n            3.  **Send Messages:** Use the BSP\u0027s API (typically a REST API) to send replies, notifications (e.g., \"Your ticket #123 has been updated\").\n        *   **Python Libraries:** `requests` library to interact with the BSP\u0027s API.\n    *   **b. WhatsApp Web (Unofficial / Automation Libraries):**\n        *   **Highly discouraged for a production system.** These libraries (like `pywhatkit`, or those based on Selenium/Puppeteer to control a WhatsApp Web instance) are prone to breaking when WhatsApp updates its web interface. They can also lead to your number being banned by WhatsApp as it violates their ToS.\n        *   If you *must* explore this for very small-scale, non-critical use: You\u0027d essentially be scraping and automating a browser instance.\n\n**4. External Database (PostgreSQL):**\n    *   **Django ORM:** Define your models:\n        *   `User` (Django\u0027s built-in, extend if needed)\n        *   `CustomerProfile` (OneToOneField to User)\n        *   `AgentProfile` (OneToOneField to User)\n        *   `Department` (e.g., Tech Support, Sales)\n        *   `Ticket` (ForeignKey to Customer, nullable ForeignKey to Agent, ForeignKey to Department, title, description, status, priority, created_at, updated_at, etc.)\n        *   `TicketMessage` (ForeignKey to Ticket, ForeignKey to User (sender), message_text, timestamp, is_internal_note (boolean), attachment_path)\n        *   `Status` (e.g., Open, In Progress, Pending Customer, Resolved, Closed) - can be a model or choices field.\n        *   `Priority` (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Urgent) - can be a model or choices field.\n        *   `Attachment` (ForeignKey to TicketMessage, file_path, file_name, mime_type)\n    *   Use Django migrations to manage schema changes.\n\n**5. Mobile Web Login Page for Engineers:**\n    *   **Responsive Design:** Ensure your web templates are responsive using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or custom media queries.\n    *   **Simplified UI:** The mobile view for engineers should be optimized for on-the-go tasks:\n        *   Viewing their assigned tickets.\n        *   Quickly updating status.\n        *   Adding brief notes/replies.\n        *   Possibly capturing photos as attachments.\n    *   **Progressive Web App (PWA) features (optional):** For a more app-like experience, consider adding a service worker for offline capabilities (e.g., viewing cached tickets) and an \"add to home screen\" manifest.\n\n---\n\n**6. Suggestions to Make This Better:**\n\n*   **Knowledge Base (KB):**\n    *   Allow agents to create KB articles.\n    *   Customers can search the KB before creating a ticket (ticket deflection).\n    *   Agents can easily link KB articles in replies.\n*   **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):**\n    *   Define response and resolution time targets based on priority/department.\n    *   Visual indicators for tickets approaching or breaching SLAs.\n    *   Automated escalations if SLAs are breached (e.g., notify manager).\n*   **Email Integration:**\n    *   Allow tickets to be created via email (e.g., support@yourcompany.com).\n    *   Send email notifications for ticket updates, new replies.\n    *   Parse incoming emails and replies to update tickets.\n*   **Custom Fields:**\n    *   Allow admins to define custom fields for tickets (e.g., \"Product Affected,\" \"Serial Number\"). Store this data efficiently (PostgreSQL\u0027s JSONB field is great for this).\n*   **Reporting \u0026 Analytics:**\n    *   Dashboards for admins and agents:\n        *   Tickets created/resolved over time.\n        *   Agent performance.\n        *   Average response/resolution time.\n        *   Tickets by status, priority, department.\n*   **Automation Rules / Workflows:**\n    *   \"If ticket priority is Urgent AND department is Hardware, assign to John Doe.\"\n    *   \"If ticket status is Resolved for 3 days and no customer reply, auto-close.\"\n*   **Ticket Assignment Logic:**\n    *   Manual assignment.\n    *   Round-robin assignment within a department.\n    *   Skill-based assignment (more advanced).\n*   **Internal Notes:**\n    *   Allow agents to add private notes to tickets, not visible to customers.\n*   **Audit Trails:**\n    *   Log all significant actions (ticket creation, status change, assignment, user login, etc.) for accountability and debugging.\n*   **Real-time Updates:**\n    *   Use WebSockets (Django Channels or FastAPI\u0027s WebSocket support) for real-time notifications of new tickets or replies without page reloads.\n*   **Full-Text Search:**\n    *   Integrate Elasticsearch or use PostgreSQL\u0027s built-in full-text search capabilities for powerful searching across tickets, messages, and KBs.\n*   **Security:**\n    *   Regularly update dependencies.\n    *   Input validation and sanitization (Django forms/DRF serializers help a lot).\n    *   Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF - Django has built-in protection, SQL Injection - ORM helps).\n    *   Secure file uploads.\n    *   HTTPS everywhere.\n*   **Testing:**\n    *   Write unit tests and integration tests (Pytest is excellent).\n\n---\n\n**Development Roadmap (Phased Approach):**\n\n1.  **Phase 1: Core Ticketing \u0026 User Roles (MVP)**\n    *   Setup Django/FastAPI project, PostgreSQL.\n    *   User authentication (login, registration for customers, predefined agents/admins).\n    *   Basic Customer role: Create ticket, view their tickets, add messages.\n    *   Basic Agent role: View all/assigned tickets, reply, change status.\n    *   Basic Admin role: Manage users (create agents).\n    *   Core models: User, Ticket, Message.\n2.  **Phase 2: Enhancements \u0026 WhatsApp (Core Channel)**\n    *   Implement Departments, Priorities.\n    *   Ticket assignment logic (manual).\n    *   Basic WhatsApp Business API integration (receive messages to create tickets, send basic replies).\n    *   Responsive design for mobile engineer view.\n3.  **Phase 3: Notifications \u0026 Workflow**\n    *   Email notifications (Celery).\n    *   Internal notes for agents.\n    *   Basic SLA tracking (e.g., visual cue for overdue tickets).\n4.  **Phase 4: Advanced Features**\n    *   Knowledge Base.\n    *   Reporting and Analytics.\n    *   Custom Fields.\n    *   Automation rules.\n5.  **Phase 5: Polish \u0026 Scale**\n    *   Full-text search.\n    *   Real-time updates (WebSockets).\n    *   Advanced security hardening, performance optimization, caching.\n    *   Comprehensive testing.\n\n---\n\nThis is a substantial project. Start small, focus on the core MVP, and iterate. Good luck, it sounds like a fantastic learning experience and a very useful tool for your company!",

The focus is on functionality – what absolutely *must* be included to make it \"viable.\" The main priority is delivering value quickly and efficiently.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Core Functions**\n\nI\u0027m now zeroing in on the absolute must-haves for Phase 1. Beyond the tech setup, user management, and core ticketing, I\u0027m defining the basic roles and admin interface. I\u0027m focusing on \"creation, viewing, commenting\" and basic permission levels. Django seems a strong choice for the MVP, and I\u0027ve started outlining a step-by-step implementation plan.\n\n\n**Mapping Permissions \u0026 Actions**\n\nI\u0027m now thinking specifically about how the basic permissions will map to the different user actions in this MVP.  The goal is to provide just enough to be useful. Customers should be able to create and view their tickets, and add comments. Agents should be able to view all tickets, comment, and change the status. I\u0027m considering using Django\u0027s built-in permissions to implement this directly to the ticketing app\u0027s views.\n\n\n**Developing MVP Features**\n\nI\u0027m now zeroing in on the UI. For the agent interface, I\u0027m thinking of a dashboard that lists all unassigned tickets. Agents can claim one with a simple button, but no status changes yet. Customers will be able to create, view, and comment on their tickets. I\u0027ll utilize Django\u0027s admin for initial user management.\n\n\n**Developing UI and Structure**\n\nI\u0027m now fully immersed in the design. I\u0027ve begun to construct the models for users, tickets, and messages. Basic views and templates are next, covering essential actions and creating an initial admin. Further out, I\u0027m thinking of building out the Customer and Agent interface. I\u0027m focusing on simplicity and functionality for the MVP.\n\n\n**Developing Phase One Plan**\n\nI\u0027m now fully immersed in the model design. I\u0027ve begun to outline how data will be stored, covering Users, Tickets, and Messages. For users, Django\u0027s User model and Groups will suffice initially. I\u0027ve also identified key model relationships.  Basic views and templates are next to handle user actions, from registration to listing tickets, all focused on the MVP.\n\n\n",

Define Models (`tickets/models.py`):**\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n\nclass Ticket(models.Model):\n    STATUS_CHOICES \u003d [\n        (\u0027OPEN\u0027, \u0027Open\u0027),\n        (\u0027IN_PROGRESS\u0027, \u0027In Progress\u0027),\n        (\u0027RESOLVED\u0027, \u0027Resolved\u0027),\n        (\u0027CLOSED\u0027, \u0027Closed\u0027),\n    ]\n\n    PRIORITY_CHOICES \u003d [ # Adding basic priority early is good\n        (\u0027LOW\u0027, \u0027Low\u0027),\n        (\u0027MEDIUM\u0027, \u0027Medium\u0027),\n        (\u0027HIGH\u0027, \u0027High\u0027),\n        (\u0027URGENT\u0027, \u0027Urgent\u0027),\n    ]\n\n    title \u003d models.CharField(max_length\u003d200)\n    description \u003d models.TextField()\n    customer \u003d models.ForeignKey(User, related_name\u003d\u0027created_tickets\u0027, on_delete\u003dmodels.CASCADE)\n    agent \u003d models.ForeignKey(User, related_name\u003d\u0027assigned_tickets\u0027, on_delete\u003dmodels.SET_NULL, null\u003dTrue, blank\u003dTrue)\n    status \u003d models.CharField(max_length\u003d20, choices\u003dSTATUS_CHOICES, default\u003d\u0027OPEN\u0027)\n    priority \u003d models.CharField(max_length\u003d10, choices\u003dPRIORITY_CHOICES, default\u003d\u0027MEDIUM\u0027)\n    created_at \u003d models.DateTimeField(default\u003dtimezone.now)\n    updated_at \u003d models.DateTimeField(auto_now\u003dTrue)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.id} - {self.title}\"\n\nclass Message(models.Model):\n    ticket \u003d models.ForeignKey(Ticket, related_name\u003d\u0027messages\u0027, on_delete\u003dmodels.CASCADE)\n    sender \u003d models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete\u003dmodels.CASCADE)\n    content \u003d models.TextField()\n    timestamp \u003d models.DateTimeField(default\u003dtimezone.now)\n    # is_internal_note \u003d models.BooleanField(default\u003dFalse) # For Phase 2/3\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"Message by {self.sender.username} on Ticket {self.ticket.id}\"\n\n```\n\n**3. Create and Run Migrations:**\n\n```bash\npython manage.py makemigrations tickets\npython manage.py migrate\n```\n\n**4. Setup User Roles (Using Django Groups):**\n\n*   Create a superuser to access the admin panel:\n    ```bash\n    python manage.py createsuperuser\n    ```\n*   Run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`\n*   Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in.\n*   Navigate to \"Groups\" under \"AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION\" and add three groups:\n    *   `Customers`\n    *   `Agents`\n    *   `Admins` (You can assign your superuser to this group)\n\n**5. Admin Panel Configuration (`tickets/admin.py`):**\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom .models import Ticket, Message\n\nclass MessageInline(admin.TabularInline): # Or StackedInline for more space\n    model \u003d Message\n    extra \u003d 1 # Number of empty forms to display\n    readonly_fields \u003d (\u0027sender\u0027, \u0027timestamp\u0027) # Prevent editing these in the inline\n\n@admin.register(Ticket)\nclass TicketAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    list_display \u003d (\u0027id\u0027, \u0027title\u0027, \u0027customer\u0027, \u0027agent\u0027, \u0027status\u0027, \u0027priority\u0027, \u0027created_at\u0027, \u0027updated_at\u0027)\n    list_filter \u003d (\u0027status\u0027, \u0027priority\u0027, \u0027agent\u0027, \u0027created_at\u0027)\n    search_fields \u003d (\u0027title\u0027, \u0027description\u0027, \u0027customer__username\u0027, \u0027agent__username\u0027)\n    # To make assigning agents easier in admin:\n    raw_id_fields \u003d (\u0027customer\u0027, \u0027agent\u0027)\n    inlines \u003d [MessageInline] # Add messages inline\n\n@admin.register(Message)\nclass MessageAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    list_display \u003d (\u0027ticket\u0027, \u0027sender\u0027, \u0027timestamp\u0027, \u0027content_excerpt\u0027)\n    list_filter \u003d (\u0027sender\u0027, \u0027timestamp\u0027)\n    search_fields \u003d (\u0027content\u0027, \u0027ticket__title\u0027, \u0027sender__username\u0027)\n    raw_id_fields \u003d (\u0027ticket\u0027, \u0027sender\u0027)\n\n    def content_excerpt(self, obj):\n        return obj.content[:50] + \u0027...\u0027 if len(obj.content) \u003e 50 else obj.content\n    content_excerpt.short_description \u003d \u0027Content\u0027\n```\n    *Now you can manage Tickets and Messages directly from the Django admin, including assigning Agents.*\n\n**6. Forms (`tickets/forms.py`):**\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom .models import Ticket, Message\n\nclass TicketCreationForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model \u003d Ticket\n        fields \u003d [\u0027title\u0027, \u0027description\u0027, \u0027priority\u0027] # Customer sets these initially\n        # Customer and status are set programmatically\n\nclass MessageCreationForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model \u003d Message\n        fields \u003d [\u0027content\u0027]\n        widgets \u003d {\n            \u0027content\u0027: forms.Textarea(attrs\u003d{\u0027rows\u0027: 3, \u0027placeholder\u0027: \u0027Type your message...\u0027}),\n        }\n        # Ticket and sender are set programmatically\n\nclass TicketUpdateForm(forms.ModelForm): # For agents\n    class Meta:\n        model \u003d Ticket\n        fields \u003d [\u0027status\u0027, \u0027priority\u0027] # Agent might also re-assign later\n```\n\n**7. Views (`tickets/views.py`):**\n\nThis will be a bit longer. We\u0027ll need views for:\n\n*   Customer Registration (optional for MVP if admins create all users, but good to have)\n*   Login / Logout (Django provides these, just need URLs and templates)\n*   Customer Dashboard (list their tickets)\n*   Create Ticket\n*   Ticket Detail (view ticket and messages, add new message)\n*   Agent Dashboard (list unassigned/assigned tickets)\n*   Agent: Assign ticket to self\n*   Agent: Update ticket status/priority\n\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import render, redirect, get_object_or_404\nfrom django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import Group\nfrom django.contrib import messages as django_messages # to avoid conflict with model name\nfrom .models import Ticket, Message\nfrom .forms import TicketCreationForm, MessageCreationForm, TicketUpdateForm\nfrom django.db.models import Q # For complex lookups\n\n# --- Helper function for checking group ---\ndef is_in_group(user, group_name):\n    return user.groups.filter(name\u003dgroup_name).exists()\n\n# --- User Registration ---\ndef register_customer(request):\n    if request.method \u003d\u003d \u0027POST\u0027:\n        form \u003d UserCreationForm(request.POST)\n        if form.is_valid():\n            user \u003d form.save()\n            customer_group \u003d Group.objects.get(name\u003d\u0027Customers\u0027)\n            user.groups.add(customer_group)\n            django_messages.success(request, \u0027Account created successfully!

URL Configuration:**\n\n*   In your main `it_ticketing_system/urls.py`:\n    ```python\n    from django.contrib import admin\n    from django.urls import path, include\n    from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views # Django\u0027s built-in auth views\n    from tickets.views import home # Import your home view\n\n    urlpatterns \u003d [\n        path(\u0027admin/\u0027, admin.site.urls),\n        path(\u0027accounts/login/\u0027, auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name\u003d\u0027registration/login.html\u0027), name\u003d\u0027login\u0027),\n        path(\u0027accounts/logout/\u0027, auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(next_page\u003d\u0027home\u0027), name\u003d\u0027logout\u0027), # Redirect to home after logout\n        path(\u0027tickets/\u0027, include(\u0027tickets.urls\u0027)), # Include your app\u0027s URLs\n        path(\u0027\u0027, home, name\u003d\u0027home\u0027), # Root path to home view\n    ]\n    ```\n*   Create `tickets/urls.py`:\n    ```python\n    from django.urls import path\n    from . import views\n\n    urlpatterns \u003d [\n        path(\u0027register/\u0027, views.register_customer, name\u003d\u0027register_customer\u0027),\n        path(\u0027dashboard/\u0027, views.customer_dashboard, name\u003d\u0027customer_dashboard\u0027),\n        path(\u0027agent/dashboard/\u0027, views.agent_dashboard, name\u003d\u0027agent_dashboard\u0027),\n        path(\u0027create/\u0027, views.create_ticket, name\u003d\u0027create_ticket\u0027),\n        path(\u0027\u003cint:ticket_id\u003e/\u0027, views.ticket_detail, name\u003d\u0027ticket_detail\u0027),\n        path(\u0027\u003cint:ticket_id\u003e/assign/\u0027, views.assign_ticket_to_self, name\u003d\u0027assign_ticket_to_self\u0027),\n        path(\u0027\u003cint:ticket_id\u003e/update/\u0027, views.update_ticket_by_agent, name\u003d\u0027update_ticket_by_agent\u0027),\n    ]\n    ```\n\n**9. Templates:**\n\nYou\u0027ll need to create HTML templates for each view. Create these directories:\n\n*   `it_ticketing_system/templates/` (for project-wide templates like `base.html`)\n*   `it_ticketing_system/templates/registration/` (for `login.html`, `register_customer.html`)\n*   `it_ticketing_system/tickets/templates/tickets/` (for app-specific templates like `customer_dashboard.html`, `create_ticket.html`, `ticket_detail.html`, `agent_dashboard.html`)\n\n**Example `templates/base.html`:**\n```html\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml lang\u003d\"en\"\u003e\n\u003chead\u003e\n    \u003cmeta charset\u003d\"UTF-8\"\u003e\n

Create `tickets/templatetags/auth_extras.py`:\n```python\nfrom django import template\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import Group\n\nregister \u003d template.Library()\n\n@register.filter(name\u003d\u0027is_in_group\u0027)\ndef is_in_group(user, group_name):\n    try:\n        group \u003d Group.objects.get(name\u003dgroup_name)\n        return group in user.groups.all()\n    except Group.DoesNotExist:\n        return False\n```\nAnd in your templates where you need it (like `base.html`), add `{% load auth_extras %}` at the top.\n\n**10. Testing:**\n\n*   Manually test all workflows:\n    *   Register as a customer.\n    *   Log in as customer, create a ticket.\n    *   View ticket, add a message.\n    *   Log out.\n    *   Log in as Admin/Superuser. Go to Django Admin. Create an Agent user and assign them to the \"Agents\" group.\n    *   Log in as Agent. View Agent dashboard.\n    *   Assign an unassigned ticket to self.\n    *   View ticket, add a message, change status.\n    *   Check customer view again.\n\n---\n\nThis is a solid foundation for Phase 1. It covers the core requirements.\n**Next Steps (after completing the above):**\n\n*   Refine UI/UX.\n*   Add more robust permission checks.\n*   Start thinking about Phase 2: WhatsApp integration and notifications.\n\nThis is a lot to digest, so take it step by step. The Django documentation will be your best friend! Good luck!",
