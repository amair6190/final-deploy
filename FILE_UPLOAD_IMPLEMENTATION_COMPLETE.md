3. **Upload files using one of these methods**:
   - Drag and drop files into the upload area
   - Click "click to browse" to select files
4. **Verify file validation**:
   - Try uploading a file larger than 5MB (should show error)
   - Try uploading an unsupported file type (should show error)
5. **Submit the ticket**
6. **View the ticket detail page** to see the uploaded attachments
7. **Download the attachments** using the download button
